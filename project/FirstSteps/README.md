# First Steps
 **Description**:  This file shows what we did to start our projet

Fisrt we tested if the sensor work by using an Arduino board and a code that measures the distance between the device and an obstacle :

The sensor dectects the obstacle well and measures the distance between the two as you can see in the two pictures.

After verify that the sensor is working, we decided to schematize our idea (where put the device) :
